# Typing_tutorial
A game where you need to type the string output in a time limit to get points. You start with 2000 points and the game ends when you either have 0 or greater than 4999 points.
If you type the output after the time limit you get a penalty based on the amount of time passed. You also get a penalty for typing the wrong characters.
This was a class project for my c++ class.
